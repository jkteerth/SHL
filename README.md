🎙️ Grammar Scoring Engine from Voice & Video

(Python | AI | Offline ASR | ML Grammar Scoring)

📌 Project Overview

This project is an AI-based Grammar Scoring Engine that evaluates spoken English from audio or video inputs.
It converts speech to text, corrects grammatical errors using pretrained transformer models, and produces a grammar score out of 100 with visual feedback.

The system supports:

🎧 Audio upload (WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC, OGG)

🎤 Live voice recording (Start / Stop)

🎬 Video upload (MP4, AVI, MKV, MOV → audio extracted)

📊 Grammar score visualization

🌊 Audio waveform visualization

🖥️ Modern CustomTkinter UI

🌐 Flask web version (optional)

This project was developed as part of an SHL assessment and follows industry-grade design practices.

🚀 Key Features

Offline Speech Recognition (Vosk – no internet required)

Grammar Correction using Transformers (T5-base)

ML-based Grammar Scoring (0–100)

Audio & Video Support

Waveform Visualization

Animated Score Visualization

Threaded Processing (No UI Freeze)

Cross-Platform (Windows tested)

Animated score chart

📊 Grammar Scoring Logic

Grammar is corrected using a pretrained T5 transformer

Score is calculated based on:

Degree of correction

Structural differences

Score range: 0–100

Designed to produce realistic human-like scores

🎯 SHL Interview Explanation (Recommended)

“The system uses offline speech recognition, transformer-based grammar correction, and ML-driven scoring to evaluate spoken English from audio and video inputs. It is fully offline, scalable, and reproducible.”

🔮 Future Enhancements

Browser-based microphone & camera

CEFR level prediction (A1–C2)

PDF report export

Web deployment (Flask / HuggingFace Spaces)

Confidence scoring per sentence
